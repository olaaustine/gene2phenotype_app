CVS export:
One gene-disease pair can have multiple annotations of allelic requirement and mutation
consequence pairs. We export one row for each pair of allelic requirement and mutation
consequence. The header fields are:  
  - gene symbol:                  HGNC gene symbol 
  - gene mim:                     OMIM number for a gene entry
  - disease name:                 Name provided by the curator
  - disease mim:                  OMIM number for a disease entry
  - disease confidence:           One value from the list of possible categories: both RD and IF, definitive, strong, moderate, limited.
  - allelic requirement:          One value from the list of possible allelic requirement attributes. Possible values are:   
                                  biallelic_autosomal, monoallelic_autosomal, monoallelic_PAR, 
                                  biallelic_PAR, mitochondrial, monoallelix_X_hem, monallelic_X_het, monoallelic_Y_hem.   
  - mutation consequence:         One value from the list of possible consequences: 5_prime or 3_prime UTR mutation, 
                                  cis-regulatory or promotor mutation, absent gene product, altered gene product structure, increased gene product level, uncertain.
  - phenotypes:                   semicolon-separated list of HPO (http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org/) IDs
  - organ specificity list:       semicolon-separated list of organs
  - pmids:                        semicolon-separated list of PMIDs 
  - panel:                        G2P panel: Cancer, Cardiac, DD, Ear, Eye or Skin
  - prev symbols:                 Symbols previously approved by the HGNC for this gene
  - hgnc id:                      HGNC identifier
  - gene disease pair entry date: Entry date for the gene disease pair into the database
  - cross cutting modifier        semi-colon separated list of possible cross cutting modifier attributes : 
                                  requires heterozygosity, typically de novo, typically mosaic, imprinted, typified by age related penetrance, typified by reduced penetrance.
  - mutation consequences flag    One value from the list of possible flags : 
                                  likely to escape nonsense mediated decay, part of contiguous gene duplication, part of contiguous genomic interval deletion, restricted repertoire of mutations.  

These release files are generated on the fly to include the latest data. Previous data freezes, including a set from 1/12/2021 using the original terms for confidence, allelic requirement etc, are available on the G2P FTP site: http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gene2phenotype/’
The _md5.txt file has the checksum value that is used to check the integrity of the file downloaded.
